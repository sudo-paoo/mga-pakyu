# PRACTICE CODES

> [!NOTE]
> Swing, an extension of the Abstract Window Toolkit (AWT) and part of the Java Foundation Classes (JFC) library, provides enhanced functionality compared to AWT. It introduces new components, expanded features for existing components, and robust event handling, including support for drag-and-drop operations.
