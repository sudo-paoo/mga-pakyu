# Looping Activities
Looping activities using java
## Scenario 1: Temperature Conversion
#### Objective: To create a program that converts temperatures between Celsius and Fahrenheit using Java, and practice using the Scanner class and loops.

Guidelines:

1. User Input: In this scenario, you'll be working with temperature conversions. The program will repeatedly ask the user for a temperature in Celsius and then convert it to Fahrenheit.
2. Using Scanner: Utilize the Scanner class to read user input. You can create a Scanner object to read data from the console.
3. Temperature Conversion Formula: Use the formula `(Celsius * 9/5) + 32` to convert Celsius to Fahrenheit.
4. Looping: Implement a loop (e.g., do-while or while) to allow the user to perform multiple conversions. Ask the user if they want to convert another temperature after each calculation.
5. Exit Option: Provide an option for the user to exit the program if they don't want to convert more temperatures.
6. Data Validation: You may consider adding input validation to ensure the user enters valid temperature values.
7. Closing Resources: Don't forget to close the Scanner object when you're done with it to release system resources.


## Scenario 2: Simple Calculator
#### Objective: To create a basic calculator program in Java, enabling users to perform arithmetic operations while practicing the Scanner class and loops.
Guidelines:

1. User Input: In this scenario, you'll build a simple calculator that allows users to perform addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division operations on two numbers.
2. Using Scanner: Use the Scanner class to accept user input for the two numbers and the desired operation.
3. Arithmetic Operations: Implement a switch-case structure to perform the selected arithmetic operation based on user input.
4. Looping: Use a loop (e.g., do-while or while) to enable the user to perform multiple calculations.
5. Exit Option: Give the user the choice to exit the calculator when they're done with their calculations.
6. Handling Division by Zero: Include logic to handle division by zero errors to prevent program crashes.
7. Data Validation: Consider adding input validation to ensure valid numbers and operations are provided.
8. Closing Resources: Don't forget to close the Scanner object when you're done with it.

## Scenario 3: Factorial Calculator
#### Objective: To create a program that calculates the factorial of a given positive integer using Java, while practicing the Scanner class and loops.

Guidelines:

1. User Input: In this scenario, you'll create a factorial calculator. The program will repeatedly ask the user for a positive integer and calculate its factorial.
2. Using Scanner: Use the Scanner class to accept user input for the positive integer.
3. Factorial Calculation: Implement a loop (e.g., for or while) to calculate the factorial of the input number.
4. Data Validation: Check that the user inputs a positive integer. If not, prompt the user to enter a positive integer.
5. Looping: Use a loop to allow the user to calculate the factorial of different numbers.
6. Exit Option: Include an option for the user to exit the program.
7. Closing Resources: Ensure you close the Scanner object when it's no longer needed.

## Multiplication Table
#### Objective: To create a program using the Scanner class and loops to generate and display a multiplication table for a given number within a specified range


Guidelines: 

1. User Input: The program prompts the user to enter a starting number, ending number, and table number.
2. Using Scanner: Utilize the Scanner class to capture user input for the specified numbers.
3. Looping for Table: Implement a while loop to generate and display the multiplication table for the given table number within the range of starting and ending numbers.
4. Data Validation: Validate that the entered values are appropriate (e.g., numeric). For enhanced robustness, consider handling cases where the starting number is greater than the ending number.
5. Printing Table: Print each multiplication step along with the intermediate result.
6. Incrementing Loop Variable: Increment the loop variable (start) in each iteration until it reaches or exceeds the ending number.
7. Closing Resources: Close the Scanner object at the end of the program to release system resources.
